Place instructions on how to run your Nodes.

****************************************************************************

- Place the package in the src folder of the enpm809e_ws or your catkin_ws.

Edit your .bashrc and add:

------> export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=/absolute/path/to/pickandplace_spring2022/workcell_809e/models:$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH

RUN THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS ON YOUR TERMINAL

1) cd ~/enpm809e_ws/src
2) source ~/.bashrc
3) cd ~/enpm809e_ws/src/pickandplace_spring2022
4) rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro noetic -y
5) catkin build
6) source ~/.bashrc
7) cd

(A) COMMAND TO LAUNCH THE ENVRIONMENT IN GAZEBO AND RVIZ
------> roslaunch workcell_809e workcell.launch

NOTE: Sometimes the manipulator falls down when the environment is launched. To solve the issue, either source the package and run the launch file again OR 
manually move the manipulator slightly in the Z direction using moveit. If the manipulator is not in the correct start position, it will not be able to 
go to the pick location and the program will terminate.

(B) COMMAND TO RUN THE NAVIGATION NODE
Open a separate terminal and run :

------> rosrun navigation_809e main

NOTE: Sometimes the navigation node does not start the Action server. To solve the issue,source the package and run the navigation node 
again(no need to terminate the launch file on the other terminal). If the navigation node has not started, the manipulator node will not start since 
no information will be published on th part_info topic.

(C) COMMAND TO RUN THE MANIPULATION NODE
Open a separate terminal and run :
------> rosrun manipulation_809e main

NOTE: If the manipulation node fails for some reason, it should be probably because of a TF exception as it might be facing an issue to get either the pick and 
place value of first part or the second. In this case, run again the manipulation node(if the position of manipulator has not changed) or eles, run (A), (B) and (C)
again.

SOURCE THE PACKAGE IF YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO FIND THE (B) AND (C) COMMANDS IN TERMINAL WHEN YOU PRESS TAB.
